>>> ****Illegal****

So, Here we are going to talk about how to capture some one in camera without his/her consent.
  

1. Normal people just click photo.  (Risk 99%)

2. Use background video recorders.as named as bvr pro download its mod and use it to capture video even when screen is off or other apps are running.
[Support both front and back cameras] (Risk 10%)

Points to be noted.

* Ethical Use.

* Try to control your body sign that you are recording some one. Its natural for all to facing fear and shriks in body while recording some one else without permission/consent but a good social engineer know how to behave in situations.

* Power saving modes must off so that app do not freeze automatically.
